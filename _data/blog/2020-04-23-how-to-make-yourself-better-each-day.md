The other day while reading book, I came across this amazing concept,

**Do Something Principle**, so most of the people commit to action only if we feel a certain level of motivation. And we feel motivation only when we feel enough emotional inspiration. We assume that these steps occur in a sort of chain reaction, like this :

*Emotional Inspiration−>Motivation−>Desirable action*

If you want to accomplish something but don’’t feel motivated or inspired, then you assume you’re just screwed.There is nothing you can do about it. It’s not until a major emotional life event occurs that you can generate enough motivation to actually get off the couch and do something.\
The thing about motivation is that it’s not only a three part chain, but an endless loop :

*Inspiration−>Motivation−>Action−>Inspiration−>Motivation−>Action−>....*

Your actions create further emotional reactions and inspirations and move on to motivate your future actions. You can take the advantage of this knowledge and reorient your mindset in following way,

*Action−>Inspiration−>Motivation*

If you lack the motivation to make an important change in your life,do something-anything,really and the harness the reaction to that action as a way to begin motivating yourself.
