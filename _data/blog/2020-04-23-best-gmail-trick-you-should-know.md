Here is one gmail hack you can use on day to day basis,

Append a plus ("+") sign and any combination of words or numbers after your email address, that can give you greater control over your inbox and save you some time and headache.

The real value in being able to manipulate your email address is that it makes it really easy to filter on those variants. For example, you could use adestmedia+bank@gmail.com when you sign up for online banking and then set up a filter to automatically star,archive or label emails addressed to adestmedia+bank.

You can also use this when you register for a service and think they might share your information. For example, I added "+donation" when I gave money to one organization once, and now when I see emails from other groups to that address, I know how they got it.
