metaDescription: how joe learned fullstack development
---
When Joe was a fresher he decided to build a personal blog website, but Joe didn't know how to build a website. Joe googled a bit and found out that single page application (SPA) is popular these days and it will be an add on skill for Joe and somehow decided to go for Angular 2+ for his application.\
\
Joe created an application with some static pages and dummy data initially for the blog post.\
But then Joe got stuck,\
\
Seeing his website wasn't crawlable by search engines Joe was upset, as Angular 2 was in the beta state that time and no-one wrote how to enable server-side rendering ( SSR ) in angular except one guy, Ross. Joe found out that guy and discussed a lot through stack overflow and e-mails and learnt, "How to make your Angular 2 applications server-side rendered."\
\
Moving forward Joe got another task in hand,\
\
"How to create admin panel ?" So that he can start posting blogs.\
\
Joe started exploring NodeJS ( using express ) along with mongoDB and learned about,

1. How authentication system works
2. How he can create auth-token-protected API endpoints to handle CRUD     operations for blogs.
3. Joe loves to be creative so he decided to handle images and rich text functionality too.

Now Joe has a fully functional personal website.\
\
Joe did one big mistake though, Joe decided to go with technology which wasn't stable at that time. You can avoid this mistake. \
\
Joe could have gone for WordPress or any similar tool but a lot of the above concepts would have been missed.\
Joe learnt a lot from this experience. That website took some time but it made Joe fall in love with JavaScript/Typescript.\
Joe didn't know what to learn initially, so Joe kept on learning whatever was required to build that website Joe didn't give up. Be like Joe.

***Happy Coding***
